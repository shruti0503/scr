Not being able to access or update my notes or schedules without an internet connection can be inconvenient, especially during commutes or when Wi-Fi isn’t available.\n\nBesides, Notion sometimes lags and especially slows down when working with large databases or pages filled with content, which hinders the workflow of doing fast updates before a class or an event.

      "pros": "Negative iconConsLimited/nonexistent design customizations, cannot manage complex projects, feels clunky at times, occasional lags with loading sections, search functionality leaves a little to be desired, challenging to learn for newbies to organizational software",
      "cons": "Switched fromGoogle WorkspaceI like Notion's visual timeline view and the way all notes, lists, tasks, etc can all be kept together. It saves me from having to click through tons of different sections, such as Sheets or Docs, or have tons of tabs open. Notion keeps things cohesive and smooth for idea and project organization."

Not only that, I wish there was a way to turn off the AI feature, or use an API key from a non-Notion AI integration. \nI also wish there were more integrations as well, but I haven't looked into that side of things for quite a while, so there might be many more that I'm unaware of.",

      "cons": "Switched fromTrelloAsanaI didn't have a go-to tool before Notion, what's good about it is that it single handedly does the job of several other apps and allows you to bring everything together in the same space."
