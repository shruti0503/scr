Channels keep discussions focused, while direct messages allow for quick, private conversations. The integration ecosystem is fantastic—tools like Google Drive, Jira, and Zoom plug in effortlessly. Search is powerful enough to find past conversations and shared files instantly. I also love how Slack works equally well on desktop and mobile, so I can stay connected anywhere. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Slack?For very active workspaces, the sheer volume of notifications can become overwhelming, and important messages sometimes get buried. Threaded conversations help, but they can be easy to miss if you’re not actively following them. It would be great if Slack provided smarter filtering or AI-driven summarization of channel activity to reduce noise. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Slack solving and how is that benefiting you?Slack centralizes team communication, replacing long email threads with fast, organized conversations. It makes it easy to collaborate across departments, share files instantly, and integrate with the tools we already use—like Jira for tracking work, Google Drive for document sharing, and Zoom for quick calls. This has reduced delays in decision-making, improved transparency across projects, and allowed remote and hybrid teams to stay connected in real time. Ultimately, it saves time, keeps everyone aligned, and helps us respond to issues faster. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\nShow More"

The platform brings everyone together in one place, so you can quickly send messages, share files, and get updates without switching between different tools or emails.\n\nSlack’s real-time messaging helps keep conversations flowing smoothly, whether you’re chatting one-on-one or in groups. It also offers features like channels and threads, which help organize discussions by topic or project, making it easier to find information when you need it.\n\nAnother great thing about Slack is its accessibility. You can use it on your computer or mobile device, so staying connected with your team is simple, even when you’re on the go. This flexibility helps teams collaborate better and stay in sync, no matter where they are. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Slack?What I don't like in slack What I don’t like about Slack is that sometimes the app experiences delays. Messages or notifications don’t always appear immediately, which can slow down communication and cause frustration during urgent conversations.\n\nThese delays can make it hard to keep up with fast-moving discussions, especially when working on tight deadlines or coordinating with team members across different time zones. It can also lead to missed messages or the need to repeat information.\n\nWhile Slack is generally reliable, these occasional slowdowns affect the overall experience. Improving the app’s speed and responsiveness would make it even better for seamless team collaboration. Sometimes it has some delay in the app. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Slack solving and how is that benefiting you?Making communication easy with colleagues in other countries is important for smooth teamwork and successful projects. Using tools that support real-time messaging, video calls, and file sharing helps bridge the distance and keeps everyone connected no matter where they are.\n\nIt’s also helpful to consider time zones and cultural differences when planning meetings or deadlines. Being flexible and respectful of each other’s working hours makes collaboration more effective and shows appreciation for the team’s diversity.\n\nLastly, using clear and simple language helps avoid misunderstandings, especially when people speak different native languages. Encouraging open communication and regularly checking in ensures that everyone stays on the same page and feels included. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\nShow More"

Hands down the most used app of our organization - we use it all the time. \n\nFeatures I find most useful - \n\n1) Easy integration with our most used apps - especially HubSpot!\nOur whole data is on HubSpot and any updates and urgent changes made by sales and CX on HubSpot triggers notifications on slack which keeps all the senior management informed about the key deals and escalations in real time. We are also able to do quality checks and audits via HubSpot - Slack integration and it has made everyone's life very easy. \n\n2) Direct sync with Google Calendar - whenever anyone is in the meeting, we can very check that by slack status without constantly checking the team's member calendar on Chrome. \n\n3) Huddle feature for urgent and quick calls is very useful, it's like having the phone number of the people and you can reach out to them whenever you want. Slack strengthens the collaboration and team culture. \n\n4) Love that we can emojis by ourselves - keeps it fun and interesting. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Slack?Honestly there is not much to dislike about Slack. The only thing that can get a bit overwhelming at times is the number of notifications. \nAs an admin - I am part of a lot of channels and the constant alerts can be distracting. But with the right notification settings, it’s easy to manage and it’s not really a big issue overall. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Slack solving and how is that benefiting you?We are a remote company and I can't imagine our operations without Slack. Slack keeps our team connected and on the same page, which is huge since a lot of us work remotely. Instead of messages, files, and meeting links being all over the place, everything’s right there in one spot. It works well with the tools we already use, like Google Drive, Asana, HubSpot so we are not constantly jumping between apps. \n\nIt has cut down on long email chains, made it easier to follow conversations, and helps us respond faster when something needs attention.

      "body": "4.5/5What do you like best about Slack?I find Slack to be an excellent, daily tool for team communication and collaboration. It's chat and \"huddle\" (audio call) functionalities make it quick and effortless to connect with my colleagues. I always have a good connection whenever I'm in a huddle, so I have no trouble hearing. Another perk of Slack is the ability to create channels. Working on numerous projects with different teams all at once, Channels helps keep my workflows organized. It's also great that you are able to send large files through Slack, and it's faster than sending an attachment via email. Also, the integration with Zoom and Outlook has created even more efficiencies in my day-to-day! Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What do you dislike about Slack?While I'm generally a big fan of Slack, there are a few minor issues. The biggest challenge is managing the constant flow of information. When a channel is very active, the number of notifications can be overwhelming, often forcing me to mute the channel entirely. I've also noticed that old project channels are rarely archived, leading to a crowded sidebar that can be difficult to navigate. It would also be nice to have a wider variety of notification sound options to choose from. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.What problems is Slack solving and how is that benefiting you?Slack primarily solves the problem of inefficient and siloed workplace communications by providing a centralized platform that reduces reliance on email.  Slack helps our teams with email overload by shifting conversations into organized, searchable channels. By integrating with a wide range of other applications like Outlook and Zoom, Slack harnesses information and workflows, improving multi-team collaboration and boosts productivity. Slacks chat messaging, audio/video calls, and search functionality create an accessible and efficient platform for our team. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.\nShow More"

It saves me from having to click through tons of different sections, such as Sheets or Docs, or have tons of tabs open. Notion keeps things cohesive and smooth for idea and project organization."
